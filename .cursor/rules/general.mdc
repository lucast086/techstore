# General Rules

## CORE PRINCIPLES
These rules define the foundation of code development in this project:

### R1: CLEAN AND CONCISE CODE
- **No unnecessary comments**
  - Code should be self-explanatory
  - Only document complex decisions or non-obvious logic
  - Avoid comments that repeat what the code already says

### R2: PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT
- **No placeholder functionalities**
  - Implement complete and usable features
  - Avoid code marked "to be completed later", "for future use"
  - Each commit should add real value to the project

### R3: STANDARDS AND DOCUMENTATION
- **Follow official rules and documentation**
  - Follow language-specific style guides
  - Use standard patterns when available

### R4: ATOMIC DEVELOPMENT
- **Develop in atomic steps**
  - Small and verifiable changes
  - One change = one specific functionality
  - Facilitate code review and testing

### R5: VERSIONING
- **Document changes by version**
  - Use Git Flow for branch management
  - Keep CHANGELOG.md updated
  - Version following Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
