# ADR-001: Monolithic Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
TechStore needs to be developed quickly with a small team while maintaining the flexibility to scale in the future. We need to choose between:
- Monolithic architecture
- Microservices architecture
- Serverless architecture

## Decision
We will build TechStore as a **modular monolith** using FastAPI, with clear separation of concerns that allows future decomposition into microservices if needed.

## Rationale

### Pros of Monolithic Architecture:
1. **Simplicity**: Single codebase, single deployment
2. **Development Speed**: No distributed system complexity
3. **Debugging**: Easier to trace issues
4. **Transaction Management**: ACID guarantees without distributed transactions
5. **Cost**: Lower operational overhead
6. **Team Size**: Appropriate for small teams

### Cons Considered:
1. **Scaling**: Must scale entire application
2. **Technology Lock-in**: Single tech stack
3. **Deploy Risk**: All-or-nothing deployments

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Modular Design**: Clear boundaries between modules
- **Service Layer**: Business logic isolated from infrastructure
- **Database per Module**: Logical separation in single database
- **API First**: All features exposed via API for future service extraction

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Faster time to market
- Lower operational complexity
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Simplified testing and debugging

### Negative:
- Horizontal scaling limitations
- Potential for tight coupling
- Single point of failure

### Future Migration Path:
When ready for microservices:
1. Extract authentication service first
2. Move to event-driven communication
3. Separate databases per service
4. Implement API gateway
