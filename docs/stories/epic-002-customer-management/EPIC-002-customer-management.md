## üöÄ Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    phone_secondary VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    address TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,  -- For soft delete
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_phone ON customers(phone);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_phone_secondary ON customers(phone_secondary);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_name ON customers(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email ON customers(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_active ON customers(is_active);
```

### Technical Decisions (Confirmed):

**Phone Numbers**:
- Two phone fields: primary and secondary contact
- No strict format validation (flexible for different formats)
- Both numbers searchable

**Account Balance**:
- Always calculated from transactions (no stored balance)
- Ensures accuracy and prevents sync issues
- Will optimize with database views if needed

**Customer Deletion**:
- Soft delete implementation (is_active flag)
- Deletion prevented if customer has non-zero balance
- Deleted customers hidden from normal views but data preserved

## üé® UI/UX Considerations
- Customer list with infinite scroll or pagination
- Quick actions on customer cards (view, edit, add sale)
- Color coding for account status (green = credit, red = debt)
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done for Epic
- [ ] All user stories completed and tested
- [ ] Customer data model fully implemented
- [ ] Search functionality optimized
- [ ] Account balance tracking accurate
- [ ] UI follows design system
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## üìù Notes
