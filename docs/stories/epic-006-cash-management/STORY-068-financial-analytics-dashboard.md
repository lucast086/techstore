## üìù Dev Notes

### Data Integration Complexity
**Multiple Data Sources** [Source: All previous epics]
- Sales data from Epic 004 (Sale, SaleItem models)
- Repair data from Epic 005 (Repair model)
- Customer data from Epic 002 (Customer model)
- Product/Inventory from Epic 003 (Product model)
- Expense data from STORY-062 (Expense model)
- Cash closing from STORY-060 (CashClosing model)

### Previous Story Dependencies
- All previous stories in Epic 006 for complete financial picture
- All previous epics for comprehensive data integration
- Chart service from analytics stories
- Export service from reporting stories

### Financial Calculations
**Key Formulas**:
- Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold
- Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
- Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Revenue) √ó 100
- Cash Flow = Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows
- Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

### Forecasting Implementation
**Simple Algorithms**:
- Moving averages for trend analysis
- Linear regression for growth predictions
- Seasonal adjustments for cyclical businesses
- Consider external factors (holidays, market conditions)

### Performance Considerations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
- Complex queries joining multiple tables
- Heavy aggregation calculations
- Cache financial data for dashboard performance
- Use background jobs for forecast calculations
- Optimize database indexes for analytics queries

### Security and Compliance [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-protocols]
- Financial data requires highest security
- Audit all access to financial analytics
- Role-based access to sensitive metrics
- Data retention policies for financial records

### Alert System Design
**Alert Types**:
- Critical: Immediate action required
- Warning: Monitor closely
- Info: General awareness
- Configure thresholds per business needs

### Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Comprehensive test data spanning multiple periods
- Test edge cases (zero revenue, negative profits)
- Verify calculation accuracy with known results
- Test forecasting with historical data
- Performance testing with large datasets

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- Financial calculation accuracy tests
- KPI calculation tests
- Multi-data source integration tests
- Forecasting algorithm accuracy tests
- Alert system triggering tests
- Complex query performance tests
- Export functionality comprehensive tests
