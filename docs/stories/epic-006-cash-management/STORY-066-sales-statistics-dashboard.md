  - `sales_dashboard.html`: Main dashboard layout
  - `_sales_overview.html`: Key metrics cards
  - `_sales_charts.html`: Chart container sections
  - `_date_selector.html`: Date range picker

### 8. Implement Interactive Charts (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add Chart.js integration for interactivity
  - Click-through on charts for detailed views
  - Responsive charts for mobile
  - Chart animations and tooltips
  - Export chart data functionality

### 9. Add Real-time Updates (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement dashboard refresh mechanism
  - HTMX polling for real-time data
  - WebSocket updates (optional)
  - Cache busting for fresh data
  - Loading indicators during updates

### 10. Export Functionality (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement data export service
  - Excel export with multiple sheets
  - CSV export for raw data
  - Include chart images in exports
  - Formatted reports with headers

### 11. Write Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for analytics service
- [ ] Test data aggregation accuracy
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Chart data generation tests
- [ ] Export functionality tests
- [ ] Performance tests for large datasets

## üìù Dev Notes

### Data Aggregation Strategy
**Performance Optimization** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
- Use database aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY)
- Index sales table by date, payment_method, customer_id
- Consider caching for expensive queries
- Implement pagination for large result sets

### Previous Story Dependencies
- Existing Sale and SaleItem models from Epic 004
- Customer model from Epic 002
- Product and Category models from Epic 003
- Chart service foundation from STORY-065

### Chart Implementation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend]
- Chart.js for interactive visualizations
- Responsive design for mobile dashboards
- Color schemes consistent with brand
- Accessibility considerations for charts

### Database Queries
**Complex Analytics Queries**:
- Use SQLAlchemy's `func.sum()`, `func.count()` for aggregation
- JOIN with product/category tables for enriched data
- Optimize with proper indexing strategy
- Consider read replicas for heavy analytics

### Security and Access [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-protocols]
- Admin-only access to sales analytics
- Rate limiting on analytics endpoints
- Data privacy considerations
- Audit logging for analytics access

### Caching Strategy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
- Cache analytics results for 15-30 minutes
- Invalidate cache on new sales
- Use Redis if available
- Cache expensive aggregations

### Real-time Updates
**Implementation Options**:
- HTMX polling every 30-60 seconds
- WebSocket for instant updates (advanced)
- Server-sent events for one-way updates
- Consider load impact of real-time features

### Testing Data Requirements
- Need substantial test data for meaningful analytics
- Use Factory Boy to generate test sales
- Test edge cases (zero sales, large datasets)
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- Analytics calculation accuracy tests
- Database aggregation tests
- Chart data generation tests
- Export functionality tests
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Real-time update mechanism tests
- Mobile responsive tests
