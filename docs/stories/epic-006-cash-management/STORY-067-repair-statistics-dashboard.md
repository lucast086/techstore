  - Repair dashboard page route
  - HTMX endpoints for filter updates
- [ ] Create templates in `src/app/templates/analytics/`
  - `repair_dashboard.html`: Main repair analytics page
  - `_repair_overview.html`: Key metrics cards
  - `_repair_charts.html`: Chart containers
  - `_repair_filters.html`: Filter controls

### 9. Technician Performance Features (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement detailed technician analytics
  - Individual performance dashboards
  - Workload distribution analysis
  - Quality metrics (rework rates)
  - Customer feedback integration

### 10. Export and Reporting (AC: 4)
- [ ] Extend export service for repair analytics
  - Repair performance reports
  - Technician productivity reports
  - Device failure analysis reports
  - Excel/CSV export capabilities

### 11. Write Tests

- [ ] Chart data generation tests
- [ ] Integration tests with existing repair system
- [ ] Performance tests for analytics queries

## üìù Dev Notes

### Integration with Existing Systems
**Epic 005 Dependencies** [Source: Current system]
- Existing Repair model with status tracking
- Technician user relationships
- Device type categorization
- Status workflow (received, diagnosing, repairing, testing, ready, delivered)

### Previous Story Dependencies
- STORY-058: Warranty model for warranty analytics
- Epic 005: Complete repair management system
- User model for technician relationships
- Chart service from previous analytics stories

### Duration Calculations
**Time Metrics**:
- Use repair status history for duration calculations
- Calculate average time between status changes
- Identify bottlenecks in repair workflow
- Consider business hours vs. calendar time

### Performance Considerations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
- Index repairs by status, technician, device_type, dates
- Cache expensive analytics queries
- Use database aggregation for large datasets
- Consider materialized views for complex calculations

### Technician Privacy
**Data Sensitivity**:
- Ensure technician performance data is used constructively
- Admin-only access to individual performance metrics
- Focus on workflow improvement, not punitive measures
- Anonymize data for general trends

### Chart Implementation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend]
- Consistent chart styling with sales dashboard
- Interactive charts for drill-down analysis
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility considerations

### Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Generate test repair data with various statuses
- Test with multiple technicians
- Verify duration calculations
- Test edge cases (repairs without completion)

### Security and Access [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-protocols]
- Admin access for comprehensive analytics
- Technician access to own performance data
- Audit logging for analytics access
- Data privacy considerations

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- Repair analytics calculation tests
- Duration calculation accuracy tests
- Technician performance metric tests
- Chart data generation tests
- Integration with existing repair system
- Export functionality tests
- Performance tests with large repair datasets
