## üìã Story Details
- **Epic**: EPIC-006 (Cash Management and Closings)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimate**: 1.5 days
- **Status**: Completed

## üéØ User Story
**As** Mar√≠a, Carlos, or Pedro,
**I want** to register business expenses,
**So that** all costs are tracked and categorized for financial reporting.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Expense form accessible from main menu
2. [ ] Required fields:
   - Amount
   - Category (dropdown)
   - Description/detail
   - Date (defaults to today)
   - Payment method (cash, transfer, card)
3. [ ] Optional fields:
   - Receipt number
   - Supplier name
   - File attachment for receipt/invoice
4. [ ] List view with filters by date range, category, amount
5. [ ] Edit allowed only same day, view-only after
6. [ ] Expenses automatically included in daily closing

## üîß Technical Tasks
### 1. Create Database Models (AC: 2, 3, 5)
- [x] Extend `src/app/models/expense.py` with `Expense` model
  - Fields: id, category_id, amount, description, expense_date, payment_method, receipt_number, supplier_name, receipt_file_path, created_by, is_editable
  - Foreign keys: category_id, created_by (user)
  - Indexes on expense_date, category_id for performance
- [x] Create migration with Alembic

### 2. Create Pydantic Schemas (AC: 2, 3)
- [x] Extend schemas in `src/app/schemas/expense.py`
  - `ExpenseCreate`: All input fields
  - `ExpenseUpdate`: Editable fields with validation
  - `ExpenseResponse`: Full expense with category name
  - `ExpenseFilter`: Date range, category, amount filters
  - `ExpenseSummary`: For daily closing aggregation

### 3. Implement CRUD Operations (AC: 4, 5, 6)
- [x] Create CRUD in `src/app/crud/expense.py`
  - `create_expense()`: Create new expense
  - `update_expense()`: Update if same day
  - `get_expenses_by_date_range()`: For filtering
  - `get_expenses_by_category()`: Category filtering
  - `get_daily_expenses()`: For cash closing
  - `check_expense_editable()`: Verify same-day rule

### 4. Implement Service Layer (AC: 5, 6)
- [x] Extend service in `src/app/services/expense_service.py`
  - `register_expense()`: Create with validation
  - `update_expense()`: Check edit permissions
  - `get_expense_summary()`: Daily/period summaries
  - `validate_expense_date()`: Ensure not future dated
  - `handle_receipt_upload()`: File management

### 5. Create API Endpoints (AC: 1, 4)
- [x] Extend routes in `src/app/api/v1/expenses.py`
  - `POST /expenses`: Create new expense
  - `GET /expenses`: List with filters
  - `GET /expenses/{id}`: Get single expense
  - `PUT /expenses/{id}`: Update expense
  - `POST /expenses/{id}/receipt`: Upload receipt
  - `GET /expenses/summary`: Period summaries

### 6. Create Web Routes and Templates (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
- [x] Extend routes in `src/app/web/expenses.py`
  - Route for expense form
  - Route for expense list
  - HTMX endpoints for filtering
- [x] Create templates in `src/app/templates/expenses/`
  - `expense_form.html`: Registration form
  - `expense_list.html`: List with filters
  - `_expense_table.html`: Table with expenses
  - Navigation menu updated

### 7. Implement File Upload (AC: 3)
- [x] Add file upload handling
  - Configure upload directory
  - Validate file types (images, PDF)
  - Generate unique filenames
  - Store file path in database

### 8. Integration with Daily Closing (AC: 6)
- [x] Modify cash closing service
  - Include expense totals in daily summary
  - Group expenses by category
  - Add to closing calculations

### 9. Write Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for expense model
- [ ] Service tests with date validation
- [ ] API tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test same-day edit restriction
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Integration test with cash closing

## üìù Dev Notes

### Data Models
**Expense Model** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#models]
- Extends expense.py with main Expense model
- Relationship with ExpenseCategory (many-to-one)
- Relationship with User (created_by)
- Store file paths, not file content

### Previous Story Context
- STORY-061 created ExpenseCategory model
- Categories must exist before expenses can be created
- Use category dropdown from previous story

### API Design
**File Upload** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#python-multipart]
- Use python-multipart for file handling
- Store files in `static/uploads/receipts/`
- Return file URL in response

### Service Layer Pattern [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#service-layer-pattern]
- Date validation in service layer
- File handling in service, not CRUD
- Business rules (same-day edit) in service

### Security Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-protocols]
- File upload validation (type, size)
- Users can only edit their own expenses
- Sanitize filenames for security
- Access control on receipt files

### Frontend Implementation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend]
- Date picker for expense date
- File upload with progress indicator
- Real-time filtering with HTMX
- Responsive table for mobile

### Integration Points
- Cash closing service needs expense totals
- Must implement `get_daily_expenses()` method
- Summary calculations for reporting

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Mock file uploads in tests
- Test date boundary conditions
- Verify integration with closing

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- Model tests with relationships
- CRUD tests with filters
- Service tests for business rules
- API tests with file upload
- Same-day edit validation tests
- Integration with daily closing
- File security tests
