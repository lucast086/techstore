# STORY-070: Fix POS Customer Debt Generation

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Epic:** [EPIC-007](./EPIC-007-system-improvements.md)

## Story
As a cashier, when a customer pays less than the total sale amount (regardless of payment method), I need the system to automatically generate a debt in the customer's account for the difference.

## Current Behavior (Bug)
- When payment method is "cash" and amount paid < total, no debt is generated
- Customer account balance is not updated with pending amount
- Transaction completes without tracking the debt

## Expected Behavior
- System should generate debt for ANY payment method when paid < total
- Customer account balance should reflect the debt immediately
- Transaction should record both paid amount and pending amount

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Debt generation works with all payment methods (cash, credit, transfer, mixed)
- [x] Debt amount = sale total - amount paid
- [x] Customer balance is updated immediately after transaction
- [x] System shows notification: "Debt of $X generated for customer"
- [x] Transaction history shows partial payment status
- [x] Debt appears in customer's account statement

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify
- `/src/app/api/v1/sales.py` - Payment processing logic
- `/src/app/services/payment_service.py` - Debt generation service
- `/src/app/services/customer_service.py` - Balance update logic
- `/src/app/models/venta.py` - Add payment_status field if missing

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current payment processing flow in POS
- [x] Identify where debt generation is bypassed
- [x] Implement debt generation for all payment methods
- [x] Add validation for partial payments
- [x] Update customer balance calculation
- [x] Add notification system for debt generation
- [x] Create unit tests for partial payment scenarios
- [x] Test with all payment methods

## Testing Requirements
- Test partial payment with cash
- Test partial payment with credit
- Test partial payment with transfer
- Test partial payment with mixed methods
- Verify customer balance updates
- Verify transaction history accuracy

## Dev Notes
- Check if `payment_status` enum includes 'partial' status
- Ensure database transaction rollback on failure
- Consider adding `debt_amount` field to sale model
