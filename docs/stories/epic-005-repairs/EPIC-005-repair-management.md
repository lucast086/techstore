    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    changed_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),

    part_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    part_cost DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,

    photo_url VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    photo_type VARCHAR(20), -- before, during, after

CREATE INDEX idx_repairs_customer ON repairs(customer_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_repairs_number ON repairs(repair_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_repairs_received ON repairs(received_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_repair_status_history_repair ON repair_status_history(repair_id);
```

### Technical Decisions:
- **Repair Numbering**: Format REP-YYYY-NNNNN (e.g., REP-2024-00001)
- **Status Workflow**: Enforced transitions with validation
- **Photo Storage**: Cloud storage with URL references
- **Notification System**: WhatsApp API integration
- **Express Repairs**: Simplified workflow for quick fixes
