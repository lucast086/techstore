## üöÄ Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    invoice_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
    sale_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    subtotal DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    discount_amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    tax_amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, partial, paid
    notes TEXT,
    is_voided BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    void_reason TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sale_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_id INTEGER REFERENCES sales(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    discount_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
    total_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE payments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_id INTEGER REFERENCES sales(id),
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    payment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_method VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- cash, credit, transfer, mixed
    reference_number VARCHAR(50),
    notes TEXT,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer ON sales(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date ON sales(sale_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_invoice ON sales(invoice_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_customer ON payments(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_date ON payments(payment_date);
```
