# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Essential Commands

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run development server (in devcontainer)
uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run development server (outside devcontainer) 
poetry run uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Run linting and formatting
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run ruff format .

# Database migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

### Git Flow Management (REQUIRED)
**CRITICAL: Use the version.sh script for ALL feature development and releases**

```bash
# Initialize Git Flow structure (run once)
./scripts/version.sh init

# Feature development workflow
./scripts/version.sh feature start feature-name  # Creates feature/feature-name branch
# [Develop your feature with regular commits]
./scripts/version.sh feature finish feature-name # Merges to development

# Release management
./scripts/version.sh release start 1.0.0   # Creates release/1.0.0 branch  
./scripts/version.sh release finish 1.0.0  # Creates v1.0.0 tag, merges to main

# Hotfix workflow
./scripts/version.sh hotfix start 1.0.1    # Creates hotfix/1.0.1 from main
./scripts/version.sh hotfix finish 1.0.1   # Creates v1.0.1 tag, merges to main & development

# Current version
./scripts/version.sh current
```

### Testing with Dependency Injection
```bash
# Run tests with test database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/test_techstore poetry run pytest

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_web/test_customers.py

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_models/test_cliente.py
```

## Architecture Overview

**TechStore SaaS** is a FastAPI-based business management system built for tech stores, focusing on customer management, product inventory, sales, and repair orders.

### Architecture Guide
**IMPORTANT**: See `docs/technical/architecture-guide.md` for detailed patterns including:
- Request flow (HTMX returns HTML, API returns JSON)
- Dependency injection requirements for testability
- Service layer patterns (shared between web and API)
- Testing with TestClient and mocked dependencies

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Jinja2 Templates + Tailwind CSS
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic
- **Code Quality**: Ruff (linting + formatting)
- **Testing**: Pytest with coverage
- **Deployment**: Railway (Production), Docker (Development)

### Project Structure
Based on the planned architecture in `docs/tech-architecture.md`:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # FastAPI application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py            # Settings and environment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ database.py          # SQLAlchemy database connection
â”œâ”€â”€ dependencies.py      # FastAPI dependency injection
â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # SQLAlchemy models (cliente, producto, venta, reparacion)
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/            # Pydantic schemas for validation
â”œâ”€â”€ crud/               # Database operation layer (Repository pattern)
â”œâ”€â”€ api/v1/             # REST API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ web/                # HTMX web interface routes
â””â”€â”€ templates/          # Jinja2 HTML templates
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: CRUD layer for database operations
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI dependencies for database sessions
- **Schema-First Design**: Pydantic models for validation and serialization

### Database
- Uses Alembic for migrations
- PostgreSQL with ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Models follow SQLAlchemy ORM patterns

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: Configured with ruff (replaces flake8, black, isort)
- **Type Hints**: Required throughout codebase
- **Line Length**: 88 characters (configured in pyproject.toml)
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically run linting, formatting, and tests
- **Docstrings**: Add docstrings for modules, classes, and functions when required by linting
- **Comments**: NEVER add inline comments unless explicitly requested by the user

### Feature Implementation
- **ALWAYS follow TDD approach**: See `docs/feature-implementation-guide.md`
- **4-Layer Architecture**: Service â†’ Schema â†’ API â†’ Web
- **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Outside-In Development**: Start with Web/API tests, work inward

### Session Workflow for Features
**In every session, follow this process:**

#### 1. Start Feature Branch
```bash
# ALWAYS start with a feature branch
./scripts/version.sh feature start feature-name
```

#### 2. Development Process
1. **Choose User Stories**: From `docs/user-stories.md` or write new ones
2. **Apply TDD Process**: Follow `docs/feature-implementation-guide.md` exactly
3. **Implementation Order**: 
   - Red Phase: Write failing tests (Web â†’ API â†’ Service â†’ Model)
   - Green Phase: Implement to pass tests (Model â†’ Service â†’ API â†’ Web)
   - Refactor Phase: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Always use TodoWrite**: Track progress through each phase
5. **Regular Commits**: Commit frequently during development with descriptive messages

#### 3. Complete Feature
1. **Final Testing**: Run full test suite and linting
2. **Final Commit**: Commit any remaining changes
3. **Finish Feature**: Merge back to development
```bash
./scripts/version.sh feature finish feature-name
```

### Git Workflow & Version Control
- **Main Branch**: `main` (production-ready code only)
- **Development Branch**: `development` (integration branch)
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Release Branches**: `release/version-number`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/version-number`

#### Commit Requirements
**CRITICAL: Use both regular commits AND Git Flow commands**

1. **During Feature Development** (Regular commits):
   - After completing each logical piece of work
   - After writing tests that pass
   - After fixing bugs or issues
   - Before taking breaks or ending sessions

2. **Feature Integration** (Git Flow):
   - Use `./scripts/version.sh feature finish` to merge completed features
   - Use `./scripts/version.sh release start/finish` for version releases
   - Use `./scripts/version.sh hotfix start/finish` for critical bug fixes

3. **Commit Message Format**:
   ```
   type: Brief description of the change
   
   - Detailed bullet points of what was implemented
   - Include technical details and architectural decisions
   - Reference any user stories or issues addressed
   - Note breaking changes or migration requirements

   ```

4. **Before Committing**:
   - Run linting: `poetry run ruff check .`
   - Run formatting: `poetry run ruff format .`
   - Run tests: `poetry run pytest`
   - Review staged changes with `git diff --staged`

5. **Commit Types**:
   - `feat:` New features or enhancements
   - `fix:` Bug fixes
   - `refactor:` Code restructuring without functionality change
   - `docs:` Documentation updates
   - `test:` Test additions or improvements
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks or dependency updates

### Environment Configuration
- Uses `.env` files for local development
- Environment variables defined in `app/config.py` using Pydantic Settings
- Database URL: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/techstore_db` (development)

### Development Environment
- **DevContainer**: Configured with docker-compose setup including PostgreSQL
- **VS Code**: Extensions and settings pre-configured for Python development
- **Port Forwarding**: 8000 (FastAPI), 5432 (PostgreSQL)

## Business Domain

1. **Clientes (Customers)**: Customer management with account balances
2. **Productos (Products)**: Product catalog with categories and inventory
3. **Ventas (Sales)**: Sales transactions with customer account integration
4. **Reparaciones (Repairs)**: Repair order workflow with status tracking

### MVP Features (In Development)
