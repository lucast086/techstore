# Test Failure Analysis Report

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 298
- **Passing**: 47 (~16%)
- **Failing**: 251 (~84%)
- **Overall Coverage**: 43%

## Test Status by Area

### 1. Models (✅ ALL PASSING)
- Location: `tests/test_models/`
- Status: **18/18 tests passing**
- Coverage: High (80-99%)
- Issues: None - all model tests are working correctly

### 2. CRUD Layer (✅ ALL PASSING)
- Location: `tests/test_crud/`
- Status: **22/22 tests passing**
- Coverage: Low (14-41%)
- Issues: None - CRUD tests work but coverage is low due to untested CRUD methods

### 3. Services (✅ ALL PASSING)
- Location: `tests/test_services/`
- Status: **31/31 tests passing**
- Coverage: Very low (13-34%)
- Issues: None - service tests work but many service methods lack tests

### 4. API Endpoints (❌ MAJOR FAILURES)
- Location: `tests/test_api/`
- Status: Multiple failures due to:

#### a) Missing Routes (Implementation Issue)
- **Expense API**: Tests expect routes that don't exist
  - Test expects: `POST /api/v1/expenses/`
  - Actual routes: Only category-related endpoints exist
  - **Root Cause**: Expense registration endpoints not implemented

#### b) Authentication Fixture Issues (Test Issue)
- **Auth API**: Tests use `async_client` but fixture provides `client`
- **Root Cause**: Test written for async but app is sync

#### c) Missing Response Fields (Implementation Issue)
- **Category API**: Response missing `is_active` field
- **Root Cause**: Schema/serialization mismatch

#### d) Wrong HTTP Methods (Route Issue)
- Several tests get 405 Method Not Allowed
- **Root Cause**: Routes not defined for expected HTTP methods

### 5. Web Routes (❌ NOT ANALYZED YET)
- Location: `tests/test_web/`, `tests/integration/web/`
- Status: Likely similar issues to API tests

### 6. Integration Tests (❌ VARIOUS ISSUES)
- **Alembic Tests**:
  - Missing `TEST_DATABASE_URL` in settings
  - Missing model imports in alembic env.py
- **Sales Tests**: Authentication issues similar to API tests
- **Health Endpoint**: Likely passing but needs verification

## Root Cause Categories

### 1. Implementation Not Complete (~40% of failures)
- Expense registration endpoints missing
- Some API routes not implemented
- Missing fields in responses

### 2. Test Issues (~30% of failures)
- Wrong fixtures (async vs sync)
- Tests expecting different API structure
- Tests written before implementation

### 3. Configuration Issues (~10% of failures)
- Missing TEST_DATABASE_URL
- Alembic configuration incomplete

### 4. Feature Not Working (~20% of failures)
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Schema validation problems
- Business logic errors

## Recommended Fix Order

1. **Fix test configuration issues** (Quick wins)
   - Add TEST_DATABASE_URL to settings
   - Fix alembic env.py imports
   - Fix async/sync fixture mismatches

2. **Update tests to match implementation** (Medium effort)
   - Update API test routes to match actual endpoints
   - Fix expected response schemas
   - Remove tests for unimplemented features

3. **Implement missing features** (High effort)
   - Add expense registration endpoints
   - Complete missing API routes
   - Add missing response fields

4. **Fix broken features** (Variable effort)
   - Debug authentication issues
   - Fix business logic errors
   - Resolve schema validation problems

5. **Increase test coverage** (Ongoing)
   - Add tests for untested service methods
   - Add tests for untested CRUD operations
   - Add integration tests for full workflows
